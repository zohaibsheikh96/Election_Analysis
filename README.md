# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The script written in this project computes key aspects of elections and also outputs the findings onto a text file. The algorithm quickly calculates the total votes casted and then assigns the votes to the respective county and the candidate. It then moves on to find each candidates/county's share of vote eventually deducing the winner/highest turn out county. These results are then transferred to a text file.
