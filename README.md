# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The script written in this project computes key aspects of elections and also outputs the findings onto a text file. The algorithm quickly calculates the total votes casted and then assigns the votes to the respective county and the candidate. It then moves on to find each candidates/county's share of vote eventually deducing the winner/highest turn out county. These results are then transferred to a text file.

## Election-Audit Results

* How many votes were cast in the election?

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

* Which county had the largest number of votes?

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Election-Audit Summary
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
